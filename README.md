datGravity
==========

Welcome to datGravity, a complete restart to [gravity](http://github.com/Guard13007/gravity).

datGravity is a simple 2D gravitational simulation with aspirations of being a
cool game.

It is recommended you do not change stuff outside of Render Settings, as changes
outside of there will cause weird things to happen and/or break.

Known Bugs
----------

Does not work in IE (probably). There is some code in one place to work in IE,
but there is at least one place I know doesn't work, and I am not worried about
fixing it unless I go much farther with this.
